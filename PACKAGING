Instructions for Packaging and Shipping MozillaBuild
-----------------------------------------------------------

System Requirements:
  * 64-bit Windows 7+
  * Existing MozillaBuild installation
  * Visual Studio 2017 or newer
  * Windows 10 SDK (included with Visual Studio installer, just be sure it's installed!)

The packageit.py packaging script is intended to be entirely self-contained. However,
it's within the realm of possibility of making changes to the host machine it's running
on, so it's recommmended to be run within a VM instead.

Packaging Instructions:
1. Run ./packageit.py from within a MozillaBuild terminal. The script has built-in defaults
   which should allow for the entire process to run without any additional arguments. It also
   supports the following command line arguments if any defaults need to be changed:
   a) "-s" : Override the path to the MozillaBuild source (default: auto-detected)
   b) "-o" : Set the path for the staging directory (default: c:\mozillabuild-stage)
   c) "-v" : Path to the Visual Studio installation (default: auto-detected)
   d) "-w" : Path to the Windows SDK installation (default: auto-detected)

2. When packaging is completed, there will be a packaged installer in the stage directory.

3. Run a virus scan of the installer through a service like VirusTotal.

4. File a bug blocking the main metabug for the new version for signing the installer. See
   bug 1458884 for a prior example of this. This signing can be done via a Taskcluster job
   triggered by RelEng.

5. Use the awscli python package to upload the signed installer to Mozilla's S3 instance.
   Also upload newer source packages for any updated packages included in the new release.
   Note that the installer should be uploaded as both a versioned filename
   (i.e. MozillaBuildSetup-3.2.exe) and as a generic MozillaBuildSetup-Latest.exe.

6. Send an email to the dev-builds, dev-platform, and firefox-dev mailing lists announcing
   the new release. Also update the wiki page: https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozillaBuild
