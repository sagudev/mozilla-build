Instructions for Packaging and Shipping MozillaBuild
-----------------------------------------------------------

System Requirements:
  * 64-bit Windows 7+
  * Existing MozillaBuild installation
  * Visual Studio 2017 or newer
  * Windows 10 SDK (included with Visual Studio installer, just be sure it's installed!)
  * MSYS2
  * Python 3 with the `requests` library installed (`pip3 install --user requests`)

The packageit.py packaging script is intended to be entirely self-contained. However,
it's within the realm of possibility of making changes to the host machine it's running
on, so it's recommended to be run within a VM instead.

Packaging Instructions:
1.  Update the VERSION file.
    (example: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-build/rev/ef213965547bd66e2dfbbfcba354c02241a85d89)

2.  Set a new tag in the format MOZILLABUILD_x_y_z_RELEASE.
    You can resolve the hash of the current revision by running "hg --debug id".
    (example: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-build/rev/cfd83e961e4defa8746d7e2b74c9da2ff44cb0f5)

3.  Update your MSYS2 environment - this is required to ensure that you don't get Cygwin DLL errors
    when the MozillaBuild MSYS2 environment is populated. Open an MSYS2 shell and run "pacman -Syu".
    If prompted, open a new shell and run it again (this is needed when the initial upgrade just
    handled core libraries).

4.  Run "./packageit.py --fetch-sources" (and the other commands mentioned in later steps) from
    within a MozillaBuild terminal.

5.  When packaging is completed, there will be an installer created in the staging directory
    ("/c/mozillabuild-stage/" by default). Package sources will be in the "src/" folder in the
    staging directory.

6.  Run a virus scan of the installer through a service like VirusTotal.

7.  Now that the new release has been built successfully, push your new release tag to
    hg.mozilla.org by running "hg push -r .". This may require updating the repository's ".hg/hgrc"
    file, changing the "default" path to be "ssh://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-build".

8.  Install the "awscli" package, if you don't have it already: "pip3 install awscli".

9.  File a bug blocking the main metabug for the new version for signing the installer. See
    bug 1766777 for a prior example of this. This signing can be done via a Taskcluster job
    triggered by RelEng.
    The signing task must fetch the artifact-to-sign via HTTP(S), so the unsigned installer should
    temporarily be available from our S3 bucket:
    "aws s3 cp MozillaBuildSetup-X.Y.Z.exe s3://net-mozaws-prod-delivery-archive/pub/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-X.Y.Z-unsigned.exe"
    This will make it available at
    "https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-X.Y.Z-unsigned.exe"

10. Once signed, remove the unsigned installer:
    "aws s3 rm s3://net-mozaws-prod-delivery-archive/pub/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-X.Y.Z-unsigned.exe"

11. Upload the signed installer to our S3 bucket as both "MozillaBuildSetup-X.Y.Z.exe" and
    "MozillaBuildSetup-Latest.exe":
    "aws s3 cp <signed-installer> s3://net-mozaws-prod-delivery-archive/pub/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-X.Y.Z.exe"
    "aws s3 cp s3://net-mozaws-prod-delivery-archive/pub/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-X.Y.Z.exe s3://net-mozaws-prod-delivery-archive/pub/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-Latest.exe"

    Also upload newer source packages for any updated packages included in the new release
    under the "src/" subdirectory. Before changing these files, it's recommended to make a local
    backup:
    "mkdir src"
    "aws s3 sync s3://net-mozaws-prod-delivery-archive/pub/mozilla/libraries/win32/src src"
    "cp /c/mozillabuild-stage/src/* src"
    "aws s3 sync --dryrun src s3://net-mozaws-prod-delivery-archive/pub/mozilla/libraries/win32/src"
    If the dry run looks good, then:
    "aws s3 sync src s3://net-mozaws-prod-delivery-archive/pub/mozilla/libraries/win32/src"

12. Send an email to the dev-platform mailing list announcing
    the new release. Also update the wiki page: https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozillaBuild
    (example: https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-platform/c/0GHhML7tY6c)
